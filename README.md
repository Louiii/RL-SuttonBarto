Follows structure of Richard Sutton & Andrew Barto, Reinforcement Learning (second edition).

## Running
In all chapters there is an 'Experiments.py' file (although in chapter 12 there are two, and in 3/4 they're spread over 3 files).
Run the figures as follows:
```
python Experiments.py
```
For some of the files with long simulation times you must go into the file to change whether the simulation is run or to just plot the figure from previous simulation data.
